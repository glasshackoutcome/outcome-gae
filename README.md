Outcome Glassware
========================
Outcome is an application for Glass that allows you to access information about a client easily and check off any objectives you want them to achieve during your meeting. The easy to use interface allows you to view client info at a glance and read more if needed. Separate tasks are represented by individual cards that can then be checked off. Safety and emergency contact info is also available for those whom have clients with allergies, disabilities, etc. Visit our website at https://outcome.squarespace.com/
